    "Description": "Air plants are actually called Tillandsias, which happens to be part of the Bromeliaceae or Bromeliad species. They have also been labelled as Epiphytes, as they do not need to have soil to grow. The air plant is often found in the jungles, mountain tops, and deserts, of Central and South America, and Mexico and the the southern United States in North America. Air plants are a variety of Epiphytes, meaning they need no soil to develop. They actually do call for a platform to commence growing. These plants are not parasitic and use their host for a method of support. The plant receives its nutrition within the moisture and dirt fibers drifting in the air. The roots are mainly implemented as a means of attaching itself to the supporting subject.",
